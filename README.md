The problem of deciding what path to take from home to work is an example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, and the number of possible solutions grows as a factorial, `n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)...*1` , where n is the number of stops that must be taken. As the value of n increases, the total number of possible solutions calculated by n! increases rapidly.  `20! = 2432902008176640000 , 10E18 power!`
