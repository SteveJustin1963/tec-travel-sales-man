MAIN:

; Permute function
PERMUTE:
    ; Base case: If all cities have been visited
    LD A, (IX + 0)            ; Load current city index
    CP NUM_CITIES              ; Compare with number of cities

    ; Recursive case: Permute remaining unvisited cities
    LD A, 0                    ; Initialize loop counter
PERMUTE_LOOP:
    CP NUM_CITIES              ; Compare loop counter with number of cities

    ADD HL, A                  ; Add loop counter to visited address

    JP NZ, PERMUTE_NEXT_CITY   ; If city already visited, skip to next city

    ; Correct recursive call structure and logic here...

CHECK_DISTANCE:
    ; Add logic to calculate and compare distance of the current tour

; Function to calculate total distance
